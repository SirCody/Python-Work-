# Python-Work-

#README

#The contents contained in this folder represent me learning the ins and outs of Python programming. 
Although considered self taught, all of these concepts were learned from "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. 

#Each file contains code that I wrote from what I learned in that respective chapter. Some files are very short (Looking at you Hello World.) Some programs are very long. 

#This is my journey through Python.
